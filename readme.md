A Culinary Guide to Kyoto

Hi Kannis, here's a guide for restaurants and bars in Kyoto.

I'm not an expert of Kyoto, so I only know few places which I've been and I can recommend to you. So, some of this guide are consisted from my friend's recommendation and from review site.

Kyoto food is more delicate and subtle than the foods in other part of Japan. It can be more fun, if you do some research before going.

Lunch is usually much cheaper than Dinner, so maybe it's wise to try expensive restaurant at Lunch.

## In Kyoto, here's the list to eat:

* Kyo-ryori (京料理) is a traditional Japanese dishes of Kyoto. It tends to have milder, delicate taste than other part in Japan.
* Sabazushi (鯖寿司) is a MUST to eat dish in Kyoto. There are many shops and restaurants which specialized in that kind of sushi. Kyoto-style sushi is different from Tokyo-style nigiri sushi.

* Bento (弁当): some restaurants provide fantastic Bento in affordable price. I recommend to try one. I think you can buy some at department stores. Also some bentos can be pre-ordered. http://kyoto.wjr-isetan.co.jp/floorevent/bento/p_3500.html
* Obanzai (おばんざい) is a basic family dishes in Kyoto style. Similar to Kyo-ryori, but simpler and cheaper than that.
* Asagayu @ Hyotei restaurant (瓢亭の朝粥) is the Japan's most famous breakfast. Splurge 4500yen breakfast which I want to try someday. http://hyotei.co.jp/en/
* Yudoufu (湯豆腐) is a extremely simple dish. Just boil tofu in a hotpot. I'm not quite sure how can it be a special dish, but two of my friends recommended it to eat in Kyoto. You can have it around Nanzenji (南禅寺)
* Nimono (煮物) is a simmered vegetables and some meats. I think this is one of the best thing in Kyoto. You can have it as a part of Bento or Obanzai. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimono
* Matsutake (松茸) is the most expensive mashroom in Japan. Autumn is the season for this one. I think you'll see if you go to fancy dinner.
* Hamo (鱧) is a kind of fish which is a regional speciality. A soup consisted with Matsutake and Hamo (鱧と松茸の土瓶蒸し) is my favorite dish in Kyoto. October might be bit late for Hamo, but I think you can find if you have luck.
* Japanese sweets: I know you don't like Japanese traditional confectionaries, but there are more lighter and smoother things exists. I recommend to try Kuzukiri (jerry noodle), Warabi-mochi (jelly with fantastic texture) or Mizu-yokan (lighter bean jelly) at Kagizen, but maybe it's out of season. http://www.kagizen.co.jp/en/

## Here's the foods to buy:

* Chirimen sansho 縮緬山椒 (Small fish + 花椒), you can buy anywhere in Kyoto. Although I'm not really sure, it matches with Thai rice... http://kyotofoodie.com/chirimen-jako-gohan-nabe-rice/
* Green tea: you can taste and blend your own green tea at Fukujuen. I've tried it once, and it was so much fun. If you like green tea, it can be fun. http://www.fukujuen-kyotohonten.com/english/floor.html

# Restaurants

## Kawashige (河繁)

This is not a fashionable place, providing traditional Japanese food for serious foodies. If you'd like to try top notch Japanese food, this is the place, but price is quite expensive (around 150-200 USD per person). Reservation recommended.

My favorite restaurant in Kyoto, but decor is not impressive at all. That's a problem as a tourist, I guess.

## Tempura Yasaka Endo (八坂圓堂 (えんどう))

Fancy Tempura restaurant. I've been here once. Dinner is a bit overpriced, but lunch can be a good deal. http://www.gion-endo.com/english/menu_lunch.html

## Kukuzen (栩栩膳)

It's a my friend's recommendation. Kukuzen is a bit modern fusion kind of Kyo-ryori, which is usually eaten by locals. Affordable, fancy decor, and good food. My friend is a serious foodie and native of Kyoto, so I think it's a good choice.

## Le Bouchon

If you get tired of Japanese food, this French bistro is my favorite too. Casual, affordable, and very authentic atmosphere. Not a hi-so meal. French comfort foods.

# Bars

## Sake Bar Yoramu

http://www.sakebar-yoramu.com/index_eng.html

This place is a MUST to visit. One Israeli guy is running a small Sake bar in a quiet residential area. He has an extensive collection of Sake. He provides all Sake by glass. I think here's the best place to taste Sake in Japan. Speaks English.

## Bar K6

http://tabelog.com/kyoto/A2602/A260202/26001197/

If you want to try real Japanese bartending, this place is one of the best in Kyoto. You can sip cocktails or some rare whiskies.

## Bar Kugel

http://tabelog.com/kyoto/A2603/A260301/26002072/

Posh champagne bar. I've never been here, but they got a good review, and is owned by a respectable owner.
